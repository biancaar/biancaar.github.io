# Bianca Rotaru — Interactive 3D Web Portfolio

🌐 Live website: [https://biancaar.github.io/](https://biancaar.github.io/)

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

The goal of this project is to present my work through an interactive experience rather than a traditional static page.
The website integrates real-time 3D rendering, scroll-driven animation and physically based materials to showcase projects in a more immersive way.

## Main Features

* Real-time 3D scene rendered with **Three.js**
* Physically Based Rendering (HDR environment lighting, shadows, normal maps)
* Scroll-driven cinematic camera animation (GSAP ScrollTrigger)
* Optimized models and textures for web performance
* Responsive layout built with React

---

## Technologies Used

* React
* Three.js
* GSAP (ScrollTrigger)
* WebGL
* PBR Texturing workflow
* GitHub Pages deployment

---

## Project Structure

* `/src/components` → React components and 3D scene logic
* `/public/models` → Optimized 3D assets (GLB)
* `/public/textures` → PBR texture sets
* `/public/env` → HDR environment maps

## About the Project

This portfolio focuses on bridging **real-time graphics and web development**.
The 3D column scene is treated as a hero object: lighting, materials and camera movement are designed to guide the viewer's attention, similar to a real-time engine presentation.
